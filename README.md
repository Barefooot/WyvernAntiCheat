# WyvernAntiCheat
Created by: **[Sindusk](https://github.com/Sindusk)**

- The way this AntiCheat is handled is not counterable by client-side modding. The server culls information before the client receives it, meaning there's no way to adjust your client to counteract the change.

 Â 
**It has two components:** 
1. Hiding hidden ores from LiveMap and XRay.
2. Countering the advantage of ESP by hiding players, mounts, and lead creatures from local if they do not have vision of them (this component can cause sever lag on larger servers and is currently a "beta" form of mod).
