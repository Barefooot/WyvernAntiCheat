# WyvernAntiCheat
  
It has two components: Hiding hidden ores from LiveMap and XRay, and countering the advantage of ESP by hiding players, mounts, and lead creatures from local if they do not have vision of them (this component can cause sever lagg on larger servers and is currently a "beta" form of mod). The way this AntiCheat is handled is not counterable by client-side modding. The server culls information before the client receives it, meaning there's no way to adjust your client to counteract the change.
